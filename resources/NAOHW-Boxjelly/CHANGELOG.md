- 1412846 a lot of changes .py files in cowriter_letter_learning, mostly fixing/ignoring type_checking errors/warnings, autoformatting
- 847d158 Add files via upload
- 0974a04 Refactoring of the code originally in learning_words_nao.py nearly complete, this update mostly consists of small refactors to stop repeating code, slight restructure of logic and parameter passing, and some added documentation.
- 637a2b3 bugfix: missing device manager variable
- e6f18c7 seperate out wrapper classes, nao_settings classes into individual file
- 5b7be02 Create .gitignore
- 880546c fix duplicated imports, fix formatting, fix missing variables
- 5c468ff fix tuple variables not using tuples, fix formatting
- 7d4b2cb Fix return of get_phrases in InteractionSettings to return all parameters it should.
- d82ca34 Refactoring is nearing completion, almost everything has been abstracted away into classes. There is still some work to be done on handling publis traj, downsampling, and how to handle interaction between SubscriberCallbacks and StateMachine (presently looks like the instance of StateMachine in main will need to be passed as an instance variable to the instance of SubscriberCallbacks. Additionally, there is a bit of tidying to be done to make sure the old variable calls are embedded within the appropriate instance classes, e.g., self.some_publisher.do_something() => self.publish_manager.some_publisher.do_something().
- 7a68f41 fix formatting, refactor remaining global variables, fix some variable usage in classes, fix some typechecking, add some comments to broken variables
- 4ebce7c The refactoring continues, made a number of new classes and methods (NaoSettings, SubscriberTopics, PublisherManager, I think some others), factoring out some logic of the StateManager into NaoSettings class as it makes sense for this to control robot actions. Probably needs 2-3 more simple classes to handle trajectory publishing, device management, and some other misc items. Need to update SubscriberCallbacks and StateManager to use the implemented classes instead of handling a bunch of instance variables.
- f0cc8a0 fix function inputs, incorrect indentations, missing imports, fix main
- 111611c Merge branch '1-ros-package-cowriter_letter_learning-is-written-in-python-27' of https://github.com/COMP90082-2023-SM1/NA-Boxjelly into letter_learning_nao-JL
- c8b8915 Substantial updates to learning_words_nao.py, mainly consisting of adding methods to StateManager class, but also some bug fixes and some refactoring to remove duplicated code. Still work to be done before it is finished; it has turned out to be much more work than anticipated and if I cannot finish it tomorrow it would be beneficial to get some help.
- f7273c9 Further update
- 3d3f4b1 Minor update, push before reviewing catkin build branch
- 94ab49c Further word on refactor of learning_words_nao.py, still a fair way to go.
- adf4fe3 Refactor callback methods in learning_words_nao.py into a class
- 0ae51a3 Convert camelCase to snake_case in learning_words_nao.py
- 71d0c59 small fix to import (previously was importing .py file for some reason)
- 4e5343d Fixed indentation issue in test_interaction_settings.py and some other imports. Added __init__.py to shape_learning directories but still facing an import issue for shape_learning, probably better to address this with updated shape_learning library as it could be python2 code causing the issue.
- 9b2a0f0 moved __init__.py from src/ to tests/ as test dirs need it
- 5d23e2a fix test cases import issues, remove __init__.py files since its not necessary (?)

- 74e5815 Finished tablet_input_interpreter.py, only remaining node to update is learning_words_nao.py, will move card to review once this is done. Created a test script but facing an import issue, to be addressed once package is fully updated.
- 91697c3 Merge branch '1-ros-package-cowriter_letter_learning-is-written-in-python-27' of github.com:COMP90082-2023-SM1/NA-Boxjelly into 1-ros-package-cowriter_letter_learning-is-written-in-python-27 Can't commit my local without pulling existing.
- 136d4e1 Finished tablet_input_interpreter.py, wrote some tests but still facing an import issue which I will address once whole package is updated. Only learning_words_nao.py remains to be updated, will move card to in review once that is done.
- afea564 add pep8 autocheck workflow note, currently: 1)  max line length is set at 120 char 2) errors/warnings do not cause workflow to fail (will be changed later in the project, once more stuff has been done)
- be07aae Merge branch '1-ros-package-cowriter_letter_learning-is-written-in-python-27' of https://github.com/COMP90082-2023-SM1/NA-Boxjelly into 1-ros-package-cowriter_letter_learning-is-written-in-python-27
- d44e5e2 improvements to testing README.md
- 1998b71 Finished display_manager_server.py and watchdog_clearer.py, have some test code for display but I am getting a weird import error, using the same import as original code. This will need to be looked into but probably push on with finishing the package updates first.
- d504143 Finish shape_display_manager.py, added test script which passes, test script added in relevant /tests subdirectory. TODO modify imports in tests contained in /tests/letter_learning_interaction/ to import relevant objects from files in /src/catkin_ws/cowriter_letter_learning/letter_learning_interaction/include/. As a result of this commit, include/ of this package is updated so the card is being moved to review on Trello.
- 950c282 Fixed typo in text_shaper
- be9ea15 Complete text_shaper.py, did not write test script as it is using shape_learning so will not be able to run it yet. NOTE: there are many references to bounding boxes and x, y coordinates. I eschewed changing variables names in this case for fear of accidentally reusing names, which I expect was the original authors motivation for using, for example,  bb, boundingbox, bounding_box, etc. For this reason, the code does not strictly adhere to our coding guidelines wrt naming, but I think it is well-motivated. This could be revisited in future, but for now I regard it as more prudent to push on with the development.
- 6405784 Delete tests from cowriter_letter_learning/include directory
- 67402d2 Merge pull request #7 from COMP90082-2023-SM1/move-tests-JL
- 7ef9174 Finished with interaction_settings.py, watchdog.py, state_machine.py and included tests for these. The test for interaction_settings.py is not working due to an issue importing from shape_learning. Some changes to text_shaper.py, but it is a work in progress. Once text_shaper and shape_display_manager.py are finished, card for include directory of this package will be moved to review.
- c888192 add testing instructions
- d78f481 move test cases into /tests/, add init files for test cases to look up py files to test (by turning dirs/subdirs into modules)
- e62a3fd add gitignore template, and autopep8 for auto pep8 code format enforcement
- 690b8b7 Minor updates to various nodes. Main changes here are adding documentation to count_shapes.py, show_shapes.py, and word_log_to_svg.py. Additionally, refactored count_shapes.py to use OOP and avoid global variables. In addition, I wrote test scripts for count_shapes.py and show_shapes.py, they are by no means exhaustive but demonstrate some functionality. The scripts are left in the working folder so they can be added to and/or ran as part of code acceptance criteria. Test scripts also added to /test in root directory for completeness. I regard the card working on letter_learning_interaction/scripts as in review as a result of this commit and will adjust the Trello board accordingly.
- a975834 Minor syntactic changes, update interpreters to use python3 in shebang lines. I think watchdog_clearer.py is done, but the rest will require more substantial revisions. Need to chase up the imports in certain files to see if conversion from camelCase to snake_case is appropriate for a lot of the function calls.
- 6bdbf0f state_machine.py has been changed to python3 (used right string method, fixed exceptions), comments added, type annotations added, interpreter changed to python3; I think that file is complete. The files watchdog.py, interaction_settings.py, and text_shaper.py have been updated to use snake_case instead of camelCase, had some other minor syntactic issues fixed, and had their interpreters changed to python3. More work is needed on these three files to include type annotations, some comments to make what the code is doing clear, and possibly fixing other minor syntactic issues for python3 validity and/or PEP8 compliance.
- 7b71c12 Modified interaction_settings.py and shape_display_manager.py, modifications were mainly changing from camelCase to snake_case, but some other minor stylistic changes for readability and change to python 3 interpreter.
- f430649 Changed filenames to proper format. Updated files to use python3 interpreter and python3 syntax. Made code more pythonic with f-strings and list comprehensions. Also included type annotations. Modified show_shapes.py so the plotting is done in a function, and when the file is run as __main__ it executes the script; this way it can be imported and plotting function used without running entire script. Lots of names needed to be changed in count_shapes.py to conform to PEP8, the other files only required minor modifications. TODO use a class in count_shapes.py to avoid the use of global variables
